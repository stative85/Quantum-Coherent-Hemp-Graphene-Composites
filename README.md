# Quantum-Coherent-Hemp-Graphene-Composites
      Research and simulation framework for creating sustainable, room-temperature quantum materials using hemp cellulose and graphene quantum dots.      Why it works: It's a bit less formal but still highly descriptive. It emphasizes the "sustainable" and "room-temperature" aspects, which are major selling points.
