# Quantum-Coherent Hemp-Graphene Composites

🚀 **Research & Simulation Framework for Sustainable Quantum Materials**  
Combining hemp cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) with graphene quantum dots (GQD) to explore room-temperature quantum coherence.

## 🔬 Project Overview
This repository hosts the experimental + computational framework for building **bio-hybrid quantum materials**.  
We are focused on:
- Hemp CNF scaffolds as sustainable, chiral topological substrates  
- Graphene quantum dots tuned for optical & quantum properties  
- Geometric optimization (Fibonacci & golden-ratio lattices)  
- Simulation, synthesis, and device-level prototyping  

---

## 🧪 Technical Goals
1. **Computational Validation** → Density Functional Theory (DFT) & NEGF transport models  
2. **Synthesis** → Hemp CNF + GQD integration, pattern assembly, photoluminescence mapping  
3. **Quantum Characterization** → Single-photon correlation, pump-probe spectroscopy  
4. **Prototype Devices** → Quantum sensors & bio-compatible electronics

## 📈 Why It Matters
- **Sustainable** → Hemp cultivation is water-efficient & carbon-negative  
- **National Security** → Eliminates rare-earth dependencies  
- **Dual-Use** → Quantum sensors for defense, medical imaging, and neural interfaces  
- **Accessible** → Room-temperature operation, no cryogenics required
